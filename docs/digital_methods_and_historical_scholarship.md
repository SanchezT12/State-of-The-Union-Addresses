Digital Methods
In order to gather all of the data and sources needed to bring the project to fruition, we had to rely heavily and digital methods. Just about all of our sources, as well as the 236 state of the union address we analyzed, were gathered from various online databases. The rest of of the sources and data, we had from previous semesters, like most of the actual speeches, and other data was collected from last semesters project when we created our own database of the presidents. From the beginning we had a good pool of information to work with. The rest of the data was pretty easily accessible from online sources.
