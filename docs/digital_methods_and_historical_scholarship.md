Digital Methods
In order to gather all of the data and sources needed to bring the project to fruition, we had to rely heavily and digital methods. Just about all of our sources, as well as the 236 state of the union address we analyzed, were gathered from various online databases. The rest of of the sources and data, we had from previous semesters, like most of the actual speeches, and other data was collected from last semesters project when we created our own database of the presidents. From the beginning we had a good pool of information to work with. The rest of the data was pretty easily accessible from online sources.


The actual text of every state of the union address was the most important bit of data we needed, because all of our questions and hypotheses required us analyzing the speeches themselves. That was our starting point, collect the speeches. Most of the state of the union addresses we already had from the previous semester. Any that were missing we were able to find available through The American Presidency Project. That site has proved to be the most important source for us, and we likely would have had a much harder time doing this without it. So between that site and the previous semester, we had all of the data we needed to start analyzing it.
