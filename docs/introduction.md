# Introduction

Historians have long studied the American Presidency, from the policies and personalities of each president. In addition, scholars have also examined the growth of executive power from its intended role outlined by the United States Constitution. We decided to search for connections between the rhetoric of the presidents and the growth of executive power by examining the State of the Union Addresses and Joint Addresses to Congress. While there are other document sets that could have been examined, the State of the Union Address gives one of the most, if not the most, comprehensive look at a president's policy agenda.

Sanctioned by Article III, Section II of the United States Constitution, the State of the Union Address allows a president to outline policy recommendations to Congress and highlight national priorities. The address may also be used to reflect on the progress of the union or events that transpired during the previous year. While the State of the Union address is delivered via a televised speech today, it was historically expressed as a written statement to Congress. Thomas Jefferson began this process in 1801, and it continued for over a century until the presidency of Woodrow Wilson in 1913.
