### Getting the Data
There are not many websites that have a data set containing all of the State of the Union Address and Addresses to a Joint Session of Congress. Additionally, the websites available are not conducive to webscraping because the html was not the same for each page. After several failed scrape attempts on three different websites we decided to follow a different approach: copy every address into individual .txt files labeled by the year it was given. There were several years that multiple addresses were given (more on this later), so this is noted by a number after the year in the .txt file name.
